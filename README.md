# EncryptWithOTP
With this small tool you can encrypt files or folders safely using the one time pad encryption.
This tool may have some bugs, it is not very well tested, so be careful while using it.
I am not responsible, if you destroy files on your computer. If you do not have the keys, it is impossible to decrypt a file.
